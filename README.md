#Title
 “Synopser - Data Summarization”

#Problem Statement / Opportunity:-
   The amount of data produced every day is mind-boggling. There is a problem of searching for relevent documents from the number of available documents 
   and absorbing    information   from it and it is very easy to get distracted and lose focus. Many times the available data is unstructured and the best
   we can do is read through several pages of the blog/e-book/article and then reach a conclusion about its effectiveness. With ever growing digit media, 
   it's time consuming to go through entire blog/e-book/article and decide whether it is useful or not.

#Project Description:-
  The aim of our project is to build a Deep learning-based solution that generates an Abstractive Text summary of content available in the Textbox of our web app entered by the user. Users can customize the summary length using a horizontal bar designed in the web app. After successfully submitting text data, the user will get summarized data in the output box. Now users can copy the Summary using the ‘Copy Text’ button.

#Implementation:- • Created HTML and CSS page using Visual Studio Code. • Created Flask App using “Hugging Face – Natural Language Processing Summarization API”. • Connected Flask App with Front-End.

#Objective of Project:- • Reduce reading time • When researching documents, summaries make the selection process easier. • Effective in creating Short Notes.
